Things to do:

 - switch to using <pyglet>

 - make <@procedure> compensate for returning true, and make it automatically call 'Actor.run'
 - make <@hook> which hooks to a given string

 - "Sprite" -> "Singleton"
 - "Clone" -> "Actor"

 - make "Singleton" and "Actor" have general properties (customizeable rendering)
 - draw order and action order distinct

 - "Singleton" should subclass "Actor"

 - "Sprite" and "Clone" as specific subclasses of Actor / Singleton
